3. If a member has three unexcused absences in a single school year, he/she will receive a written notification from the advisor/Faculty Council. Should that same member have still another unexcused absence after the written notification, he/she will be pending dismissal.
4. Violations of the law or school regulations can result in immediate consideration of the dismissal of a member (see Section 5 below). These violations include, but are not limited to, DWI, stealing, destruction of property, cheating, truancy, or possession, selling, or being under the influence of drugs or alcohol at school, school-related activities, or in the community.
5. Offenders of the school conduct code (such as use of profanity, failure to comply, unexcused absences, excessive tardiness, etc.) will receive a written warning notification. A conference may be requested by either party (Faculty Council or student/parent). If the member is involved in another violation of the school conduct code, the member may be considered for dismissal.
6. Chapter officers, as representatives of the chapter, can be removed from their positions as a consequence of disciplinary action taken by the Faculty Council.
7. In all cases pending dismissal:
 * The members will receive written notification from the adviser/Faculty Council indicating the reason for consideration of dismissal.
 * The member will be given the opportunity to respond to the charge(s) against him/her at a hearing before the Faculty Council prior to any vote on dismissal (in accordance with due process identified in Article X of the National Constitution). The member has the opportunity to present his/her defense either in person or via a written statement presented in lieu of the face-to-face hearing. Following the hearing, the Faculty Council will then vote on whether to dismiss the member. A majority vote of the Faculty Council is needed to dismiss any member.
 * The results of the Faculty Council vote will be presented to the principle for review, and then stated in a letter sent to the student and parents. Dismissed members must surrender any membership emblems to the adviser.
The Faculty Council’s decision may be appealed to the principal and afterwards according to provisions of the school district discipline policies.
 * A member who is dismissed or resigns may never again be considered for membership in the National Honor Society.

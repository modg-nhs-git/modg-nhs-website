To sign up for tutoring, please click on the link below. You must sign up at least three days before the session.

## FAQ

##### Q: How do I sign up for tutoring? 
A: Click on this link: http://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f0449acaf28a2fa7-tutoring. It will take you to a Signup Genius page where you will find dates and times for tutoring. To sign up, check the boxes on the far right and scroll down to click “Sign up.” You will be taken to another page where you will have to fill out some information. In the “My Comment” field, please elaborate the difficulty you and your child are having with the subject material. All times shown are in Pacific Time.

##### Q: Can I sign up for more than one tutoring session at once?
A: Yes. If you are signing up different children, then please sign up separately (go through the entire process once for each child). If you are signing up the same child more than once (for weekly tutoring, for example), then check the desired blocks on the far right and continue as usual. However, we do ask that you sign up the same child for no more than three sessions at once.

Q: How long does each tutoring session last? 
A: Normally, each session will last up to thirty minutes. If the child needs extra help, it’s possible that they may be able to stay longer.

##### Q: What grades do you tutor?
A: We tutor grades 3-8.

##### Q: What subjects do you tutor?
A: We tutor Latin, Religion, Science, English, History, Math, and Writing Skills. If you would like your child to be tutored in another subject, please email the tutoring leaders at nhstutoring@motherofdivinegrace.org.

##### Q: What happens if not enough tutors are available?
A: We will try to get you in on the day you signed up for, but if there aren’t enough tutors available, we will email you to reschedule.

##### Q: I have a question that’s not covered here. Who do I contact?
A: You can email the tutoring leaders (Mary, Clem, Julia, and Kiersten) at this email address: nhstutoring@motherofdivinegrace.org. If the question is about a certain subject (rescheduling your Latin session, for example) we ask that you put the name of the appropriate leader in the subject.

Mary is head leader and does History and English
Kiersten tutors Writing Skills and Math
Clem tutors Religion and Science
Julia tutors Latin

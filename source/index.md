*“Established in 1921, the National Honor Society (NHS) is the oldest and most respected student recognition organization in the United States. Membership in NHS distinguishes students who have committed themselves to the pursuit of academic excellence, community improvement, and personal development.”*

The National Honor Society shows not only that a student has excelled academically, but also that a student has also displayed significant leadership and service capabilities in the past. More importantly, the NHS allows for such students to improve in all said areas: as scholars, as leaders, and as servants to others.

The Pope Leo XIII Chapter of the National Honor Society currently has 93 active members. If you are interested in becoming a member of the Pope Leo XIII Chapter of the NHS, please see [articles IV & V of the Bylaws](/categories/information/bylaws.html#Article_IV:_Members).
